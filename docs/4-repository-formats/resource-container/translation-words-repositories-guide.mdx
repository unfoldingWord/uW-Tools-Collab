# Translation Words Repositories Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers how to handle Translation Words repositories in Door43. These repositories contain biblical term definitions and explanations organized in nested Markdown files, providing translators with comprehensive term references.

**Repository Type Covered:**
- **Translation Words**: Biblical term definitions and explanations

## Repository Characteristics

### Translation Words Repositories

**Examples**: `en_tw`

**Key Characteristics:**
- Subject: "Translation Words"
- Container type: "dict" (dictionary)
- Content: Nested Markdown files with term definitions
- Format: Markdown articles
- Organization: Hierarchical directory structure
- Scope: Comprehensive biblical terminology

## How to Identify Translation Words Repositories

**Step 1: Check the Manifest Subject**
- Look for `dublin_core.subject` field in manifest.yaml
- Should be "Translation Words"

**Step 2: Verify Container Type**
- Check `dublin_core.type` field
- Should be "dict" for Translation Words repositories

**Step 3: Confirm File Structure**
- Look for nested directory structure with Markdown files
- Should have `bible/` directory with subdirectories
- Files should be individual term definitions in `.md` format

## Manifest Structure

### Translation Words Manifest

```yaml
dublin_core:
  identifier: 'tw'                     # Resource identifier
  language:
    identifier: 'en'                   # Language code
    direction: 'ltr'                   # Text direction
  subject: 'Translation Words'         # Resource type
  type: 'dict'                        # Dictionary resource
  version: '84'                       # Resource version
  relation:                           # Dependencies
    - 'en/ult'                        # Literal translation
    - 'en/ust'                        # Simplified translation
    - 'en/twl'                        # Translation Words Links

projects:                             # No projects array for dict type
  # Translation Words use directory structure instead
```

**Key Differences from Other RC Types**:
- Container type is "dict" not "bundle" or "help"
- No `projects[]` array - uses directory structure
- Files organized in nested directories, not flat structure

## File Structure Patterns

### Translation Words Directory Structure

```

        ├── 📄 bread.md              # General term
        ├── 📄 shepherd.md           # General term
        ├── 📄 temple.md             # General term

```
