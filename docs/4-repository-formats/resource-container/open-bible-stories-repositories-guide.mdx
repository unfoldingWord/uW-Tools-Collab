# Open Bible Stories Repositories Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers how to handle Open Bible Stories (OBS) repositories in Door43. These repositories contain Bible overview stories in Markdown format, designed to provide a comprehensive Bible narrative in 50 interconnected stories.

**Repository Types Covered:**
- **Open Bible Stories**: 50-story Bible overview
- **OBS Translation Notes**: Story-specific translation guidance
- **OBS Translation Words Links**: Word links for OBS content

## Repository Characteristics

### Open Bible Stories Repositories

**Examples**: `en_obs`, `en_obs-tn`, `en_obs-twl`

**Key Characteristics:**
- Subject: "Open Bible Stories" (or OBS variants)
- Container type: "bundle" (for main OBS) or "help" (for support resources)
- Content: Markdown files with story content
- Format: Markdown or TSV (for support resources)
- Organization: 50 numbered stories
- Scope: Complete Bible narrative overview

## How to Identify Open Bible Stories Repositories

**Step 1: Check Repository Name Pattern**
- Look for "obs" in repository name
- Main OBS: `{lang}_obs`
- OBS support: `{lang}_obs-{type}` (like `en_obs-tn`)

**Step 2: Check the Manifest Subject**
- Look for `dublin_core.subject` field in manifest.yaml
- Should contain "Open Bible Stories" or "OBS"

**Step 3: Verify Content Structure**
- Main OBS: Look for numbered Markdown files (01.md, 02.md, etc.)
- OBS support: Look for TSV files with story-based organization

## Manifest Structure

## Content Analysis

### Open Bible Stories Content Structure

**Story Markdown Format**:
```markdown
# 01. The Creation

![OBS Image](https://cdn.door43.org/obs/jpg/360px/obs-en-01-01.jpg)

In the beginning, God created the universe. He created the earth, but it was empty and dark. God's Spirit was there over the water.

![OBS Image](https://cdn.door43.org/obs/jpg/360px/obs-en-01-02.jpg)

Then God said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which he called "night." God created the light on the first day of creation.

## Differences from Bible Repositories

| Aspect | Open Bible Stories | Bible Text |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **Content Unit** | Stories (50) | Books (66) |
| **Internal Structure** | Frames within stories | Verses within chapters |
| **Narrative Style** | Simplified overview | Complete text |
| **Images** | Extensive image integration | No images |
| **Scope** | Bible overview | Complete Scripture |
| **Target Audience** | General audience | Translators/scholars |
| **Cross-References** | Story-to-Bible mapping | Verse-level precision |

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Image Handling
**Problem**: Stories reference many images that may not be locally available
**Solution**: Implement image caching and fallback strategies

### Issue 2: Story-Bible Mapping
**Problem**: Connecting story content to specific Bible passages
**Solution**: Use source references and create story-to-Bible index

### Issue 3: Frame Navigation
**Problem**: Stories have internal frame structure different from verses
**Solution**: Build frame-aware navigation and reference system
