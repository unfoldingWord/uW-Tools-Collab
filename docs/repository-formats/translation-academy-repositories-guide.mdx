# Translation Academy Repositories Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers how to handle Translation Academy repositories in Door43. These repositories contain translation training materials organized as nested Markdown articles, providing comprehensive methodology and cultural guidance for translators.

**Repository Type Covered:**
- **Translation Academy**: Translation methodology and training materials

## Repository Characteristics

### Translation Academy Repositories

**Examples**: `en_ta`

**Key Characteristics:**
- Subject: "Translation Academy"
- Container type: "man" (manual)
- Content: Nested Markdown files with training articles
- Format: Markdown articles in categorized directories
- Organization: Hierarchical topic structure
- Scope: Comprehensive translation training

## How to Identify Translation Academy Repositories

**Step 1: Check the Manifest Subject**
- Look for `dublin_core.subject` field in manifest.yaml
- Should be "Translation Academy"

**Step 2: Verify Container Type**
- Check `dublin_core.type` field
- Should be "man" for Translation Academy repositories

**Step 3: Confirm File Structure**
- Look for nested directory structure with Markdown files
- Should have multiple category directories (translate/, checking/, etc.)
- Articles split into multiple files (title.md, subtitle.md, 01.md)

## Manifest Structure

### Translation Academy Manifest

```yaml
dublin_core:
  identifier: 'ta'                     # Resource identifier
  language:
    identifier: 'en'                   # Language code
    direction: 'ltr'                   # Text direction
  subject: 'Translation Academy'       # Resource type
  type: 'man'                         # Manual resource
  version: '84'                       # Resource version
  relation:                           # Dependencies
    - 'en/tn'                         # Translation Notes (references TA)
    - 'en/ult'                        # Literal translation
    - 'en/ust'                        # Simplified translation

projects:                             # No projects array for manual type
  # Translation Academy uses directory structure instead
```

**Key Differences from Other RC Types**:
- Container type is "man" not "bundle" or "help"
- No `projects[]` array - uses nested directory structure
- Articles split across multiple files per topic

## File Structure Patterns

### Translation Academy Directory Structure

```
en_ta/
├── 📄 manifest.yaml                 # Resource Container manifest
├── 📄 LICENSE.md                    # License file

    ├── 📁 translation-guidelines/   # General guidelines
    └── ...                          # More intro topics
```

### Article File Structure

**Each Topic Has Three Files**:
- **title.md**: Short article title
- **sub-title.md**: Descriptive subtitle or question
- **01.md**: Complete article content

## Content Analysis

### Translation Academy Article Structure

**Standard Article Format** (from 01.md):
```markdown
# {Title}
## {Subtitle}

### Description

{Explanation of the translation concept or issue}

### Reason This Is a Translation Issue

{Why translators need to understand this topic}

### Examples From the Bible

{Biblical examples demonstrating the concept}

### Translation Strategies

{Specific strategies for handling this issue}

### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied

{Practical examples showing strategies in use}
```

**Sample Article** (translate/figs-metaphor/01.md):
```markdown
# Metaphor
## What is metaphor and how do I translate it?

### Description

A metaphor is a figure of speech in which someone speaks of one thing as if it were a different thing because he wants people to think about how those two things are alike.

### Reason This Is a Translation Issue

The Bible that you translate from may use metaphors to express certain ideas. Your language might not use metaphors for some of those ideas.

### Examples From the Bible

> Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan (Amos 4:1a ULT)

The prophet Amos called the women of Samaria "cows of Bashan." He was not saying that they were literally cows, but that they were like cows in certain ways.

### Translation Strategies

If a metaphor would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:

1. Use a simile that would be understood in your culture
2. State the meaning plainly without using a figure of speech

### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied

1. Use a simile that would be understood in your culture

> Listen to this word, you who are like cows of Bashan
```

## How to Process Translation Academy Repositories

### Step 1: Verify Repository Type

**Check Manifest Fields**:
- Confirm subject is "Translation Academy"
- Verify container type is "man"
- Note absence of projects array (uses directory structure)

### Step 2: Map Directory Structure

**Discover Categories**:
- Identify main category directories (translate/, checking/, intro/)
- Get complete topic list within each category
- Map the three-file structure for each topic

**Expected Categories**:
- **translate/**: Translation methodology topics (~50-100 topics)
- **checking/**: Quality assurance topics (~10-20 topics)
- **intro/**: Introduction and overview topics (~5-10 topics)

### Step 3: Process Individual Articles

**For Each Topic Directory**:
- Read title.md for the article title
- Read sub-title.md for the descriptive subtitle
- Read 01.md for the complete article content

**Build Article Structure**:
- Combine title, subtitle, and content
- Parse markdown structure within content
- Extract sections (Description, Examples, Strategies, etc.)

### Step 4: Build Topic Index

**Create Navigation Structure**:
- Index all topics by category
- Build cross-reference mappings
- Create searchable topic database

### Step 5: Handle Cross-References

**Internal References**:
- Articles reference other TA topics
- Build internal linking system
- Enable navigation between related topics

**External References**:
- Translation Notes reference TA articles via rc:// links
- Enable reverse lookup from TN to TA

## Differences from Other Repository Types

| Aspect | Translation Academy | Translation Words | Translation Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Container Type** | "man" | "dict" | "help" |
| **File Structure** | 3 files per topic | 1 file per term | 1 TSV per book |
| **Organization** | Category/topic/files | Category/term files | Flat TSV files |
| **Content Focus** | Training methodology | Term definitions | Verse guidance |
| **Cross-References** | Topic relationships | Bible passages | TA articles |
| **Target Use** | Learning/training | Reference lookup | Contextual help |

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Three-File Article Structure
**Problem**: Each topic split across title.md, sub-title.md, and 01.md
**Solution**: Build article assembly process to combine files correctly

### Issue 2: Deep Directory Nesting
**Problem**: Topics nested in category/topic/file structure
**Solution**: Implement recursive directory traversal and indexing

### Issue 3: Cross-Reference Complexity
**Problem**: Articles reference each other and are referenced by Translation Notes
**Solution**: Build comprehensive cross-reference database
