# Specialized Resource Container to Scripture Burrito Migrations

This section covers migration of custom, non-standard, and legacy Resource Container types that don't fit the standard categories. These migrations require specialized handling and custom mapping strategies.

## ðŸ”§ **Specialized Migration Guides**

### **[Custom Resources](custom-resources)**
Migration guide for non-standard Resource Container types.

**Covers**:
- Custom resource types and subjects
- Non-standard file structures
- Custom metadata fields
- Flexible mapping strategies

### **[Legacy Formats](legacy-formats)**
Migration guide for older Resource Container versions.

**Covers**:
- Older RC format versions
- Deprecated field mappings
- Legacy content structures
- Compatibility considerations

## ðŸ“‹ **When to Use Specialized Migrations**

Use these guides when:
- Resource Container doesn't match standard types (Bible, TN, TW, TA)
- Custom `dublin_core.subject` values
- Non-standard file organization
- Legacy RC format versions
- Experimental or prototype repositories

**Note**: These are placeholder files created during restructuring. Detailed content should be developed based on actual custom and legacy RC types encountered in the ecosystem.
