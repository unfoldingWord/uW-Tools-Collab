# Translation Academy Resource Container to Scripture Burrito Migration Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides specific instructions for migrating Translation Academy Resource Containers to Scripture Burrito format. Translation Academy repositories contain training materials in nested Markdown files that map well to Scripture Burrito's peripheral resource capabilities.

**Applicable Repository Types:**
- **Translation Academy**: TA (Translation methodology and training materials)

## Migration Overview

### Why Migrate Translation Academy Repositories

**Benefits of Scripture Burrito for Translation Academy**:
- **Dedicated Peripheral Support**: Scripture Burrito has peripheral flavor designed for training materials
- **Enhanced Article Organization**: Better handling of multi-file article structure
- **Improved Cross-Referencing**: Better relationship modeling to other resources
- **Explicit Content Structure**: Clear identification of article components
- **Training Workflow Support**: Better support for systematic training progression

### Migration Complexity

**Complexity Level**: ⭐⭐⭐ **Medium**
**Data Loss**: ❌ **None** (all RC data preservable with enhancement)
**Time Required**: 3-4 hours for automated conversion
**Manual Review**: Significant (verify article structure and cross-references)

## Pre-Migration Analysis

### Step 1: Analyze Source Repository

**Check Repository Characteristics**:
- Verify subject is "Translation Academy"
- Confirm container type is "man"
- Note absence of projects array (uses directory structure)
- Examine nested directory organization (translate/, checking/, intro/)

**Expected File Structure**:
- manifest.yaml with dublin_core section
- Multiple category directories
- Three-file article structure (title.md, sub-title.md, 01.md)
- LICENSE.md file

### Step 2: Analyze Article Structure

**Article Organization**:
- **translate/**: Translation methodology topics (~50-100 articles)
- **checking/**: Quality assurance topics (~10-20 articles)  
- **intro/**: Introduction and overview topics (~5-10 articles)

**Article File Structure**:
- **title.md**: Short article title
- **sub-title.md**: Descriptive subtitle or question
- **01.md**: Complete article content

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Create Scripture Burrito Metadata

**Base Metadata for Translation Academy**:
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "format": "scripture burrito",
    "version": "0.3.0"
  },
  "identification": {
    "name": "unfoldingWord® Translation Academy",
    "abbreviation": "TA",
    "description": "Translation methodology and training materials"
  },
  "languages": [
    {
      "tag": "en",
      "name": "English",
      "direction": "ltr"
    }
  ],
  "type": {
    "flavorType": {
      "name": "peripheralResource",
      "currentScope": {
        "trainingTopics": ["figs-metaphor", "translate-names", "grammar-connect"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Convert Article Structure to Ingredients

**For Each Article Topic**:

**Create Ingredient for Complete Article**:
- **Key**: Use topic path (e.g., "translate/figs-metaphor/article.md")
- **mimeType**: "text/markdown"
- **role**: "guide"
- **scope**: Topic-specific scope with category information

**Combine Three Files into One**:
- Merge title.md + sub-title.md + 01.md into single article
- Create unified Markdown structure
- Preserve all content and formatting

**Example Article Combination**:
```markdown
# Metaphor
## What is metaphor and how do I translate it?

{Content from 01.md}
```

**Example Ingredient**:
```json
"translate/figs-metaphor/article.md": {
  "mimeType": "text/markdown",
  "role": "guide",
  "scope": {
    "trainingTopic": "figs-metaphor",
    "category": "translation",
    "difficulty": "intermediate"
  },
  "description": "How to translate metaphors"
}
```

### Step 3: Handle Category Organization

**Map RC Directory Structure to SB Categories**:
- **translate/** → `"category": "translation"`
- **checking/** → `"category": "checking"`
- **intro/** → `"category": "introduction"`

**Enhanced Scope with Training Metadata**:
```json
"scope": {
  "trainingTopic": "figs-metaphor",
  "category": "translation",
  "subcategory": "figures-of-speech",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "prerequisites": ["translate-unknown"],
  "relatedTopics": ["figs-simile", "figs-hyperbole"]
}
```

### Step 4: Convert Dependencies and Relationships

**RC Relations to SB Relationships**:
- Translation Notes (which reference TA) become "target" relationships
- Bible texts become "related" relationships
- Other training resources become "related" relationships

**Example Relationships**:
```json
"relationships": [
  {
    "type": "target",
    "flavor": "parascripturalWordAlignment",
    "id": "en_tn",
    "description": "Translation Notes reference these training articles"
  },
  {
    "type": "related",
    "flavor": "textTranslation",
    "id": "en_ult",
    "description": "Bible text used in training examples"
  }
]
```

### Step 5: Enhance with Training-Specific Features

**Add Training Progression Metadata**:
```json
"type": {
  "flavorType": {
    "name": "peripheralResource",
    "trainingStructure": {
      "categories": ["translation", "checking", "introduction"],
      "totalTopics": 85,
      "difficultyLevels": ["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"],
      "learningPath": [
        "intro/translation-guidelines",
        "translate/translate-unknown", 
        "translate/figs-metaphor"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Examples

### Example 1: Translation Methodology Article

**Source RC Structure**:
```
en_ta/
└── translate/
    └── figs-metaphor/
        ├── title.md          # "Metaphor"
        ├── sub-title.md      # "What is metaphor..."
        └── 01.md             # Complete content
```

**Converted SB Structure**:
```
en_ta_sb/
├── metadata.json
└── translate/
    └── figs-metaphor/
        └── article.md        # Combined content
```

**Combined Article Content**:
```markdown
# Metaphor
## What is metaphor and how do I translate it?

### Description
A metaphor is a figure of speech...

### Examples From the Bible
> Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan (Amos 4:1a ULT)

### Translation Strategies
1. Use a simile that would be understood...
```

### Example 2: Complete Category Migration

**Category: translate/ (Translation Methodology)**

**SB Ingredient Organization**:
```json
"ingredients": {
  "translate/figs-metaphor/article.md": {
    "mimeType": "text/markdown",
    "role": "guide",
    "scope": {
      "trainingTopic": "figs-metaphor",
      "category": "translation",
      "subcategory": "figures-of-speech"
    }
  },
  "translate/translate-names/article.md": {
    "mimeType": "text/markdown",
    "role": "guide", 
    "scope": {
      "trainingTopic": "translate-names",
      "category": "translation",
      "subcategory": "cultural-concepts"
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Validation

### Step 1: Validate Article Assembly

**Check Article Combination**:
- Verify title, subtitle, and content are properly merged
- Confirm markdown structure is preserved
- Check that all sections are included

### Step 2: Validate Training Organization

**Organization Checks**:
- Verify all categories are properly represented
- Confirm topic relationships are maintained
- Check that training progression is logical

### Step 3: Test Training Workflow

**Functional Testing**:

## Migration Benefits

### Enhanced Capabilities in Scripture Burrito

**Better Than RC**:
- **Unified Article Structure**: Combined articles vs three-file system
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Rich scope information vs directory structure only
- **Better Cross-Referencing**: Relationship system vs simple relation array
- **Training Progression**: Explicit learning paths vs implicit organization
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Access to peripheral resource tools

### Preserved RC Features

**No Data Loss**:
- All training content preserved
- Article structure maintained
- Cross-references preserved
- Category organization maintained
- Training methodology preserved

## Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: Three-File Article Structure
**Problem**: Each topic split across title.md, sub-title.md, and 01.md
**Solution**: SB allows unified article structure - combine files into single ingredient

### Issue 2: Complex Cross-References
**Problem**: Articles reference each other extensively
**Solution**: SB relationship system provides better cross-reference modeling

### Issue 3: Training Progression
**Problem**: Learning path implicit in RC directory structure
**Solution**: SB scope can include explicit prerequisite and progression information
